# Lesson 5: Putting It All Together: Let's Make A Game!

Now, let's try adding up everything we've learned so far, and upgrade our Program from "Dragging A Cursor Around" to something more akin to a Full Game. In the vein of the phenomenal [MegaRunner](https://www.ohsat.com/tutorial/megarunner/megarunner-1/) by Andrej Preradovic (A.K.A. [Ohsat](https://www.ohsat.com/).), let's try making it a Side-Scrolling, Infinite Runner type of Game!

We can start off by editing our movable "Cursor" from the last lesson into our playable "Character" in this one. Rather than colliding with the edges of the screen, we'll want to check collision with both the floor and our obstacles; the former will be calculated similarly, and the latter will be a new thing for us to learn.
